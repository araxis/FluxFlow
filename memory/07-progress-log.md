- Confirmed source, tests, and package README no longer contain source-application transport terms.
- Ran release tests successfully.
- Created local prerelease package files in `artifacts\packages`.
- Initialized git on `main`.
- Created private repository `araxis/FluxFlow`.
- Pushed the initial commit to `origin/main`.

## Remaining
